## INSTRUCTIONS

Remember to switch to the "Game Time" comparison in LiveSplit in order to remove load times. (Right click LiveSplit -> Compare Against -> Game Time)



## FEATURES

When using the autosplitter, the timer should:

- Start automatically after the first loading screen
- Pause on all loading screens
- Split automatically after the score screen at the end of each stage, and after you beat Asimov
- Reset if you return to the title screen - will also save your gold splits automatically

Note that the auto splitter only works for speedrun modes.
